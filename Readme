 This is the project to check the hand value for Cribbage game. There will be
 five input which stand for the five cards. The first four card is the hand cards, 
 and the last card is the start card. The aim of this project is check specific combination 
 to define the value of these five cards.
 
 • (15s) 2 points are scored for each distinct combinations of cards that add to 15. 
  For this purpose, an ace is counted as 1, a jack, queen or king is counted as 10, 
  and other cards are counted as their face value. For example, a hand with a 2, 3, 5, 10, 
  and king scores 8 points: 2 points each for 2+3+10, 2+3+king, 5+10, and 5+king.
  
 • (Pairs) 2 points are scored for each pair. 
  With 3 of a kind, there are 3 different ways to make a pair, 
  so 3 of a kind scores 6 points. Similarly, 4 of a kind scores 12 points for the 6 possible pairs.
 
 • (Runs) 1 point is scored for each card in a run of 3 or more consecutive cards 
  (the suits of these cards need not be the same). Aces are low in cribbage, 
  so Ace, 2, 3 is a run, but Queen, King, Ace is not. For example, a 2, 6, 8, and 9, 
  with a 7 as the start card scores 4 points for a 4 card run. 
  It also scores a further 6 points for 15s (6+9, 7+8, and 2+6+7).
 
 • (Flushes) 4 points is scored if all the cards in the hand are of the same suit. 
  1 further point is scored if the start card is also the same suit. 
  Note that no points are scored if 3 of the hand cards, plus the start card, are the same suit.
 
 • (“One for his nob”) 1 point is scored if the hand contains the jack of the same suit as the start card.
 
 It is just a homework.
